Odin-Recipes
This repository contains a variety of delicious recipes that I've compiled while completing exercises from The Odin Project.

About this Project
The Odin Project is a comprehensive open-source curriculum for learning web development. This project, in particular, focused on HTML basics - a fundamental building block in web development.
Each recipe contained in this repository is an individual HTML file that I've created to demonstrate my understanding of HTML structure, tags, and attributes.
As I continue to learn and grow with The Odin Project, I'll be updating this repository with more complex HTML structures and eventually CSS styling. Stay tuned!
